      <h1>About</h1>
      <div>I am a Software Engineer living in Montclair, New Jersey. I have a background in Digital Marketing that has taught me to approach every project with an imaginative eye. In my free time you might find me making some ice cream, watching a rom-com, or strumming the  ol' acoustic. I haven't read a book in five years.
